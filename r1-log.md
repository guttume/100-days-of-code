The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 06, Thursday, 2021].

## Log

### R1D1

Started learning [CP algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/). Understood and implemented the [Binary Exponentiation](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/binary-exp.html) algorithm. Solved two exerices mentioned on the website as well. The exercises have been solved in C++. However, I have implemented the algorithm in C++, C, Java, Kotlin, PHP, Python, Rust, Go, Dart and Javascript.

### R1D1

Learnt [Euclidean algorithm](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/euclid-algorithm.html) to find out GCD of two numbers. Implemented the algorightm in c, c++, python, java and kotlin.

### R1D3

Solved two more problems on binary exponentiation. Got to know, how to find first k digits of any number raised to a large power without calculating the power of the number. Also implemented [Extended Euclidean algorithm](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/extended-euclid-algorithm.html) in c++, javaa and python.

### R1D4

Implemented (Binary GCD)[https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/euclid-algorithm.html#toc-tgt-5] in c++.
