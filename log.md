# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 06, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started learning [CP algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/). Understood and implemented the [Binary Exponentiation](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/binary-exp.html) algorithm. Solved two exercises mentioned on the website as well. The exercises have been solved in C++. However, I have implemented the algorithm in C++, C, Java, Kotlin, PHP, Python, Rust, Go, Dart and Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Understanding and implementing algorithms are comparatively easier than using them in problem solving. I tried to solve [third problem](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=onlinejudge&page=show_problem&problem=1970) mentioned on the website but could not solve it. I will try to work on it tomorrow.
