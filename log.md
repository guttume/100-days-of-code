# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 06, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started learning [CP algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/). Understood and implemented the [Binary Exponentiation](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/binary-exp.html) algorithm. Solved two exercises mentioned on the website as well. The exercises have been solved in C++. However, I have implemented the algorithm in C++, C, Java, Kotlin, PHP, Python, Rust, Go, Dart and Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Understanding and implementing algorithms are comparatively easier than using them in problem solving. I tried to solve [third problem](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=onlinejudge&page=show_problem&problem=1970) mentioned on the website but could not solve it. I will try to work on it tomorrow.

### Day 1: May 07, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learnt [Euclidean algorithm](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/euclid-algorithm.html) to find out GCD of two numbers. Implemented the algorightm in c, c++, python, java and kotlin.

**Thoughts:** Euclidean algorithm is a quick way to calculate GCD of two numbers.

### Day 2: May 09, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved two more problems on binary exponentiation. Got to know, how to find first k digits of any number raised to a large power without calculating the power of the number. Also implemented [Extended Euclidean algorithm](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/extended-euclid-algorithm.html) in c++, javaa and python.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes it is very difficult to understand the implementation of an algorithm in code even though I have understood the algorithm properly.

### Day 3: May 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Implemented (Binary GCD)[https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/euclid-algorithm.html#toc-tgt-5] in c++.

**Thoughts:** Modulo operations are expensive and can be avoided by using bit operations
